						<h4 style="font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif">"Something I noticed was the girls reluctance when answering the question. Most of the boys seemed to know exactly what they would do in what field, and they answered very confidently. The girls seemed more hesitant by saying things like “I don’t know,” and “I guess,” after answering, and some almost stated their business ideas like a question." </h4>
						<h4>-Amelia, 15 </h4>

						<h4 style="font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif">"So I think that all the girls definitely went for a more feminine businesses, like hair and baking. The guys certainly went for more basic businesses, like retail or a shoe store. They went for businesses that would be easy to run and are more common, where as the girls went for more creative and harder to run businesses."</h4>
						<h4>-Catherine, 16</h4>

						<h4 style="font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif">"The boys were more confident in their answer. The girls had to take a bit to think, and the didn’t sound too enthusiastic or like they believed it would happened. Tt sounded more-likely for the boys with the way the phrased it."</h4>
						<h4>-Liyah, 16</h4>
						<h4 style="font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif">"It seems a lot of the boys chose more like- financially beneficial businesses I think. Like the one who said he would go into merchandise and stuff. The girls seemed to lean more towards artsy things like fashion and hair and literature."</h4>
						<h4>-Stephanie,16</h4>
						<h4 style="font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif">"I feel like there was slight difference between the girls and guys in the sense that the guys had thought about business a little bit more than the girls. I feel like there was slight difference between the girls and guys in the sense that the guys had thought about business a little bit more than the girls.I, being a girl, havent thought much about it either if I'm honest. It just hasn't been something that I see as accessible to me."</h4>
						<h4>-Daijah, 16 </h4>
						<h4 style="font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif">I like it, there's honest awnsers to real questions. There is a noticable distinction between the boys and girls responses. The boys went for more goods and material form of merchandise, among other things for the purpose of making money. I favor the girls responses, they choose businesses that give back to their community/consumers. Wether the book store, law firm, advice giving social media, they chose something beneficial to a broader spectrum of people. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the boys responses, but the girls are thinking of the needs of others how their business can help them, all while still building a succsessful business.</h4>
